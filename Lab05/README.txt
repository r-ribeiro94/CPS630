    footer.jade - the footer information for the webpage.

/LAB05/public/stylesheets
    about-style.css - the styles for the about me page.

Run node app.js on your terminal (make sure you have nodejs and npm installed), and go to localhost:8080 on your web browser.
If for whatever reason there is a module missing just type npm install and it should solve the problem.
